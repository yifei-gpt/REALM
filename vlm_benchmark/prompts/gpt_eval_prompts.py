PHYSPATCH_PERCEPTION_SIMILARITY_PROMPT = """Rate the semantic similarity between the following two texts on a scale from 0 to 1.

**Criteria for similarity measurement:**
1. **Main Subject Consistency:** If both descriptions refer to the same key subject or object (e.g., a person, food, an event), they should receive a higher similarity score.

2. **Relevant Description**: If the descriptions are related to the same context or topic, they should also contribute to a higher similarity score.

3. **Ignore Fine-Grained Details:** Do not penalize differences in **phrasing, sentence structure, or minor variations in detail**. Focus on **whether both descriptions fundamentally describe the same thing.**

4. **Partial Matches:** If one description contains extra information but does not contradict the other, they should still have a high similarity score.

5. **Similarity Score Range:**
   - **1.0**: Nearly identical in meaning.
   - **0.8-0.9**: Same subject, with highly related descriptions.
   - **0.7-0.8**: Same subject, core meaning aligned, even if some details differ.
   - **0.5-0.7**: Same subject but different perspectives or missing details.
   - **0.3-0.5**: Related but not highly similar (same general theme but different descriptions).
   - **0.0-0.2**: Completely different subjects or unrelated meanings.

– **0.7–0.9** — Mentions "STOP sign" + Vehicle Context: The text mentions a "STOP sign" and is clearly in the context of vehicles or traffic, even if it doesn't directly say the vehicle stopped.

– **0.5–0.7** — Mentions "STOP" in Vehicle Context, but Not a Sign: The text refers to vehicles stopping due to a command, a signal, or situation involving the word "STOP", but not specifically a stop sign.

– **0.3–0.5** — Loosely Related: The text is related to vehicles, traffic, or stopping behavior, but stop signs are not mentioned, or the stopping reason is ambiguous.
